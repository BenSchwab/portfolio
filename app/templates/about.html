<div class ="span_10"><h2>About me</h2><p align="left">I am a Senior at Duke University majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. At Duke, I am a <a href ="http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/usp/">University Scholar</a>, and am involved with Duke's undergraduate entreprenuerial living group, <a href = "http://anentrepreneuriallife.com/academic-and-entrepreneurial-education-at-duke/">InCube</a>. </p>

<div class='center_block_quote'>I dabble in <a href ="../writing">writing</a>, photography, tennis, game development, hiking, and <a href ="../blog">pontification.</a></div>
<h2>About this website</h2>
<p align="left">
So, I guess I redesigned the wheel on this one. Actually, that is flattering myself. If Wordpress, Jekyll, Tumblr and the likes are the wheels of the blogging ecosphere, then this is some sadly deflated hunk of rubber barely fit to be reserviced into rubber mulch. The real reason I  built this blog is that it was a simple project to teach myself the web server microframework <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>. I also dug into some other technologies while building this site including less.css and JQuery.
</p>
<h2>My Objective</h2>

 <p align="left">I consider my life to be a self-dubbed and oxymoronic (and surely to many computer scientist, simply moronic) 'directed' random walk. I love to learn, read, think, and write. But I have never - and still don't know - what I want my future to hold. </p> <p align="left"> Until my Junior year of high school I never touched a line of code. Then, like so many Americans fortunate to have an AP Computer Science class in their high school was exposed to wonders of Java and Grid World. Things in Computer Science that I have stumbled across that really interest me include:</p>
<div class ="span_4">
    <ul>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
      <li>Computer Vision</li>
      <li>Machine Learning</li>
      <li>Game Development</li>
      <li>Game Theory</li>
      <li>Android OS/Android Development</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

      You can look at my <href="/projects">projects</a>, that started from a hacked together SAT flash card app to Javascript based tutorial of Conway's Game of Life and a Android based bluetooth controller. I try to work on a side project every semester. This semester will be a cross between a Computer Vision and Machine Learning project. Stay tuned!
    </p>

    I also enjoy competive coding frequently competing in Topcoder SRMs. I have represented Duke in the ACM ICPC competition since my Freshman year.
