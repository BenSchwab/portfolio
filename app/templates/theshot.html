<h2>The Shot</h2>

<p>This is my father photographed with friends, when he was young. He is easy to pick out in the faded, black-and-white Polaroid tinged gold with age. He and his friends are sitting on a wooden porch looking at the camera, with shy smirks. I notice my father’s broad chin and piercing dark eyes – features which became part of a set when he had me. A worn leather football is visible by their feet. They are hopefully casual, trying to put on a façade of nonchalance to sway the unfeeling judgments of the lens. I carefully re-examine the picture. While I cannot mistake the figure of my father, I am unsure, under his features - happy and youthful - who is really looking at me. This does not <i>feel </i>like the man who raised me. My father was quiet, stern, and more rigid than the hickory cane he had to walk with because of the shrapnel lodged in his leg from the war.</p>

<p>My first memory of my father was playing pool in our basement. It was late - past my six-year-old bedtime. The exhausted ceiling fans swirled the stale smoke of my father’s cigars, which he smoked methodically as his black eyes scanned the table for his next shot. My mom yelled down that it was time for bed. My dad winked at me and insisted on one more game. I was tired, but I couldn’t conceal a big, front-toothless smile, which was reciprocated with a long drag on his cigar. I wasn’t tall enough to reach completely above the table, and carried around a wooden stool for my shots. I set up at the front of the table, chalked the cue, and broke. The balls on the table collided in blissful randomness, and a few settled into the pockets to remain in stoic silence. My father could have easily run the table, and leave me nothing. But I remember the easy shots he would miss, and how I would eagerly move my stool to different locations, studying the prospects on the table with unshakable focus, while my father was studying the prospects of his son as if he were the eight-ball. My father was waiting. Waiting for his shot.</p>

<p>By the age of 17, my father had assessed my manliness. I was a weak pacifist, and a failure. Don’t get me wrong – I wasn’t some book obsessed, acne-ridden twig. I was the quarterback on my high school football team, and my filial chin and eyes were commanding the attention of the flirtatious school girls. But to his great disappointment, I was also an intermittent hippie. One humid June day, I was lounging on our front lawn wearing a shirt adorned with a peace symbol. I lazily tossed my favorite football, watching as it would briefly eclipse the sun, and then - like a magnet - accelerate back to my hands. My father limped onto the porch. Despite the heat, he always wore neatly pressed slacks to hide the constant atrophy of his leg from the shrapnel. My father barked for me to join him, and we sat down in the shade of our porch. There was no need for a preamble, his countenance said it all. He grinded his teeth as he spoke. It was time for Adonis to step up and throw a bomb and not a football. His mouth looked empty without his cigar. I dropped the football and it rolled around our feet. In an uncommon burst of emotion, I yelled that I was against the war, against sending our youth to die, against fake democracy, and against self-interested authority. My father clamped a firm hand on my shoulder, our black eyes meeting briefly, and told me it was time to be a man. I brushed his hand off, stitched my composure together and returned to the lawn, casually kicking the football, hands tucked into my jean pockets. That was the second-to-last time my father ever talked to me. While I continued to throw touchdowns, and succumbed to the gravity of girls, my cousin went off to fight in Vietnam. I knew my father wished that my cousin were his son. </p>

<p>On the bitter cold Sundays in January, my father would get up early; the struggled thumps of his cane echoed through the house. His curses would fill the crisp morning air as he fought the recalcitrance of the furnace in the basement. The pool table with a lone eight ball became a platter for his tools. He was still waiting to take his shot. After emerging victorious from his extended dual with the furnace, my father would secretly dust off my football trophies, and sigh at his ragged reflection in the golden metal, before returning to bed. The house was always warm when I woke up. No one ever thanked him. What did I know of love’s austere and lonely offices?</p>

<p>It was a July night. I was 19, home from my first year of college. The air was dry, but hummed with prescient knowledge. My father lay dying on his bed, but the game was his; it was time to take his shot. He handed me the picture I now hold in my hands, and whispered, “Nothing gold can stay”. He closed his eyes, and the iron door of the future clanged open, ordering forth air so frigid that I wished my father had turned the furnace on during that summer night. And I knew that part of my life was over. </p>

<p>Today is my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday. I put the Polaroid back into my tattered notebook, and slide it into my cargo pants. The golden glow of the Vietnam morning is fading; a crow is circling in the deep summer blue. I swing my M16 rifle over my shoulder, as my squad leader orders us to report for a debriefing. God sweeten the bitter judgments of our lives. We wish so much.</p>

<p><b>Key to the Plagiarism</b></p>

<p><i>Plagiarized poems and a brief summary of my interpretation of their original meaning</i></p>

<p>· <i>My Father Photographed with Friends</i> – William Bronk</p>

<p>o A poem about a son looking at a photograph of his father, bitter about the degenerative transformation of aging.</p>

<p>· <i>Eight Ball</i> - Claudia Emerson</p>

<p>o A poem about a hierarchical relationship, and the implications of an act of mercy from the dominant force. Symbolized by a game of pool.</p>

<p>· <i>Feeling the Draft</i> – Bob Hicok</p>

<p>o A poem about a boy too young to be seen as adult and serve in the army. He is both enjoying and resentful of the golden period that is youth.</p>

<p>· <i>Those Winter Sundays</i> – Robert Hayden</p>

<p>o A poem about the unacknowledged sacrifices the man of the house makes out of love.</p>

<p>· <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i> – Robert Frost</p>

<p>o A poem about the transition from the golden bliss of youth to adulthood that uses nature imagery.</p>

<p>· <i>End of Summer</i> - Stanley Kunitz</p>

<p>o A poem about the transition from youth to adulthood that uses seasonal and nature imagery.</p>

<p><i>The purpose:</i></p>

<p>The first major goal of this piece is to show the literary and stylistic bridge between poems and short stories. The two mediums share very similar goals: to create short, vignette-like, depictions of a scene or a moment. Poems are looser in the style of their prose and more abstract in their meaning. However, short stories are essentially a “meta-poem”. Poems and short stories accomplish the same things, just on a larger scale. This scale is constraining in some ways, liberating in others. I thought a good way to demonstrate the relationship between short stories and poems would be to stitch together several different poems with related themes into one short story. This primary goal, however, spawned other difficulties. How would the different symbols in each of the poems propagate throughout the piece? How would I handle the poems’ different dictions? Overcoming these difficulties created goals of their own for the piece. For example, I attempt to show that symbols between poems can bleed into each other. Also, while maintaining a single voice throughout a short story is essential, I have the goal of showing that even if you alter the diction of the poem, its essential meaning can still be found.</p>

<p>I had to select a theme for the piece. I chose the powerful (and greatly Americanized) themes of a father-son relationship and the transition from childhood to adulthood. As all the poems encompassed this theme – or an aspect of it – I wanted to show that they could work together to create a <i>new</i> commentary.</p>

<p>The general structure of the piece is that each paragraph plagiarizes one of the above poems. The degree and style of the plagiarism varies in each paragraph. The following sections break down the short story into paragraphs to analyze specifically how they contribute to the goals of the piece.</p>

<p><i>Paragraph 1: </i></p>

<p>This paragraph plagiarizes <i>My Father Photographed with Friends.</i> However, only two lines are verbatim selections:</p>

<p>“This is my father photographed with friends, when he was young.” </p>

<p>“He and his friends are sitting on a wooden porch looking at the camera, with shy smirks.”</p>

<p>Lines in the poem inspire the remaining sentences in the paragraph; however, I had to alter them slightly in order to create a frame for the overall plot for the story. This entailed constructing elements of my “own” creation. These elements are an extension of the poem. For example, I imagined what someone looking at an old picture of their father as a youth might notice. As a result, I added the connection of the physical traits of the narrator to his father. Also, I twisted the meaning of some lines in the poem. For instance, when the narrator wonders if he is really looking at his father, I make the tone less cynical. Finally, I added some ideas, such as the golden hue to help establish the picture as a symbol of his father’s youth. (Gold is a symbol I steal from<i> Nothing Gold Can Stay </i>to symbolize youth.)</p>

<p><i>Paragraph 2: </i></p>

<p>The second paragraph plagiarizes <i>Eight Ball</i>. The verbatim selections I used are: </p>

<p>“My father could have easily run the table, and leave me nothing. But I remember the easy shots he would miss…”</p>

<p>“The exhausted ceiling fans swirled the stale smoke…” </p>

<p>While the original poem has symbolic extensions that highlight the power difference in a relationship that is most likely not a father/son relationship, I think it is a powerful scene. Particularly, I like the idea of the dominant figure intentionally leaving an opportunity for the second, weaker figure, and how they both analyze it. This is the main idea I steal from the poem. Like the poem, I choose to symbolize this with a game of pool. I propagate this symbol throughout my story. However, the symbol is slightly different from the symbol in the original poem. In the poem, the pool game (most likely) symbolizes the relationship of the two individuals. In my story, I choose for the pool game to be more specific. Specifically, I start the symbol with the line: “The balls on the table collided in blissful randomness, and a few settled into the pockets to remain in stoic silence.” This sentence establishes that balls on the table are energetic youth, and balls in the pocket are responsible adulthood. Therefore, the manipulation of the pool table is a symbol of the father manipulating his son’s transition into an adult. By missing shots, the father is allowing his son to have his youth. Thus, it is also appropriate that the father studies his youthful son as if he is the eight ball. The pool symbol is still a symbol of a relationship – just more specific. The pool symbol is also the first of a handful of recurring symbols that demonstrate how one poem’s symbol (albeit altered) can effectively bleed into other poems. </p>

<p><i>Paragraph 3:</i></p>

<p>The second flashback plagiarizes <i>Feeling the Draft</i>. This is one of my looser plagiarisms, and the form and meaning of this paragraph is completely different from the original. The original poem features a boy too young to serve in the army and to be respected by adults. In addition, it is not the main character who plays football in the original. Finally, the father in the poem has an opinion of the war that is ambiguous. Essentially, the poem only serves as a basis for plot elements. I steal the football player, the “Adonis” who is attracted to the influence of girls, and the father grinding his teeth in contemplation and contempt. These elements allow me to create the “golden” age of youth and of little responsibility. In this paragraph, I also drive my plot, introducing the declining health of the father, and increase the tenuous nature of their relationship. </p>

<p>I added my own symbol with the football that plays with the gold symbol from <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i>. Note how the football briefly blocks out the sun (gold in color). Yet, just as it does so, it is drawn back into the son’s hand. Symbolically, the son is not ready to have the “golden glow” of his youth extinguished. Likewise, when the father tells his son to join the military and become a man, the son is on the verge of losing his childhood. However, just like the football stops blocking the sun and falls into the narrator’s hand, the narrator is drawn back into the sunny yard to enjoy the carefree life of childhood after the confrontation. In addition, the porch scene creates a mirror image of the scene described in the photograph in the first paragraph. The father is once again sitting on the porch with a football at his feet. Yet, he is completely different from his youthful self. I intentionally describe the narrator to be very similar to the nonchalant father in the photograph. While this paragraph does not include a large amount of direct plagiarism, it extends symbols from <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i> and <i>My Father Photographed with Friends</i>.</p>

<p><i>Paragraph 4:</i></p>

<p>This paragraph is a plagiarism of <i>Those Winter Sundays</i>. Notably, this paragraph serves to show what it really means to be a father and a man - two things that the poem does very strongly. Some of the actions stolen from the poem fit naturally to drive my plot, such as the father dusting the football trophies (a parallel of “polishing my good shoes”). This shows that the father is still secretly proud of his son. His problem with his son is not with his son’s life, but more a concern that he will not properly turn his son into an adult. The idea of heating the house as a symbol of fatherly protection is also lifted from the poem. I choose to make this a recurring symbol in the death scene. There are only two verbatim quotes:</p>

<p>“No one ever thanked him.”</p>

<p>“What did I know of love’s austere and lonely offices?”</p>

<p>Despite the lack of much direct plagiarism, this paragraph <i>is</i> a very close plagiarism - mostly in theme and symbols. The major deviation arises in the recurrence of the pool game symbolism, when I note the pool table again. It is now clear that the father’s “shot” is bringing his son to adulthood. Appropriately, the father who is still protecting his son by heating the house, is still waiting to pocket the eight-ball.</p>

<p><i>Paragraph 5:</i></p>

<p>The father’s death scene plagiarizes <i>End of Summer</i>. I thought this was a good location for this plagiarism because <i>End of Summer</i> has strong language which describes the transition from childhood to adulthood, which the narrator experiences at this point. However, the diction in this poem is different from the diction in my story. Therefore, I change lines such as “An agitation in the air admonished me that my life would turn on a hinge that night” to “The air was dry, but was humming with prescient knowledge”. The meaning is very similar, but the latter is written in my voice, and thus fits the piece better. Next, I reveal the coup de grâce of the piece, when the father makes his “shot” that is appropriately giving his son a “shot” of himself as a youth. He does this to make the point “Nothing gold can stay”, and the narrator finally realizes it is time for him to accept adulthood. This captures the main theme of the piece: the father and son are incredibly similar despite being diametric opposites. In fact, they are pretty much the same person, just in different points in their lives. This is the same idea captured in the last line of my piece (taken from the last line of<i> My Father Photographed with Friends</i>).</p>

<p>I stole the idea of the door of adulthood opening, and a cruel wind blowing forth, from <i>End of Summer</i> and it fits naturally with the furnace symbol created by <i>Those Winter Sundays</i>. The narrator feels the “cold” responsibility of adulthood for the first time in the absence of his father and wishes his father could turn on the furnace - even though it is a summer night.</p>

<p><i>Paragraph 6:</i></p>

<p>This paragraph contains elements plagiarized from <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i>, <i>End of Summer</i>, and <i>My Father Photographed with Friends</i>. The golden glow of dawn is inspired by <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i>. Appropriately, the narrator is looking at the “golden” picture of his father’s (and concurrently his own) youth. When the narrator has to return to the responsibility of being a man (serving in the army) the dawn changes to a blue day, just as in <i>End of Summer</i>. I end the poem with lines from <i>My Father Photographed with Friends</i> to frame the story in that poem, and because I find the lines very powerful. The lines summarize the complexity of expectation, judgment, and love that a father-son relationship possesses.</p>

<p><b>Reflection on the process</b></p>

<p>When I first began this project, I tried to think in terms of genres and themes to serve as the foundation of the plagiarism. I found it interesting that many different works, free of plagiarism (at least consciously), can be related with identical themes. I was drawn to the period of growing up, and the father-son relationship, probably from its prevalence in American literature, such as Bildungsroman novels and the poems such as the ones I used. My first conscious goal was to show that different works of the same theme could coalesce and create one work of the same theme. This, as you can probably imagine, is like wondering if mixing different ice-cream flavors will taste good. Unless you disregard common sense, it would be very hard to create a bad tasting mixture. Likewise, creating a single work from related themes was not the difficult part of the assignment. The more interesting result of the plagiarism occurs in the transition from poem to short story. </p>

<p>As I wrote the first draft of the piece, I found it very natural to give each poem its own paragraph, and to let the plot I created unite them. I constructed the plot by some minor alterations and additions to poems (<i>My Father Photographed with Friends, Those Winter </i>Sundays) and major changes to others (<i>Feeling the Draft</i>). Also, I quickly realized that the vastly different diction and styles of the poems would have to be melded into one. Now, I would like to claim that the overall voice of the piece is my own. Yet, objectively, it is a plagiarism too. The first two poems I plagiarized (<i>My Father Photographed with Friends</i> and <i>Eight Ball)</i> were both written in a relatively short story-like tone. In addition, they both included great descriptive metaphors and sharp, yet lyrical, diction. It shocked me how easily I slid into their form. The new words I wrote were inspired not only by the words in the poem but also by <i>how </i>the poets wrote them. And it was this style that I carried throughout the piece, and used to alter the styles of the other poems. After completing the first draft, everything fit together. It just worked. Yet, coming back to improve on the piece with the second draft I realized something was missing. That was the symbolism contained in many of the poems. Each paragraph aptly showed many of the symbols in the poems, but there was no carry over. And larger symbols are a defining aspect of short stories. Therefore, this was my major area of revision for my second draft. While the two drafts share essentially the same story, and all the same plagiarized texts, they are on two different playing fields in terms of symbolism. I was surprised how natural it was to implement the symbol of gold from <i>Nothing Gold Can Stay</i> into the other poems and how easily the game of pool from <i>Eight Ball</i>, could be referenced in scenes created by other poems. Even the idea of adulthood being “cold” from <i>End of Summer</i> combined with the furnace as a symbol of protection from <i>Those Winter Sundays</i>. These symbols made each other stronger. The meaning of each paragraph has the potential to be deeper than the meaning of the single poem they are derived from, because the paragraphs reference the rich symbols created by other poems. However, framing a poem in a short story <i>does </i>narrow its scope, and takes away some of its universality created by the ambiguity due to the brevity of the poems.</p>

<p>Lastly, you may wonder if the poems I selected are essential to my purpose; are they actually good selections? While I do not feel these exact poems are essential to my purpose – others could have worked just as well – and, while some poems were vastly altered, these poems became part of my interlocking story. I could not drop a single poem without crippling the rest of the structure. I feel that last sentence is a testament to the fact that the poems are indeed successful selections.</p>

<p>This project was enjoyable, and intellectually stimulating. Manipulating two genres really required me to understand what makes a poem a poem, and a short story a short story. Lastly, this assignment gave me a lot of sympathy for the narrator in <i>Old School</i>. While, I certainly put more original work in my short story than the narrator did in his, I do feel like this story is <i>mine</i>. I feel like I even own the lines I directly plagiarized. This is probably because I put so much work into bridging the genres, that even verbatim selections had to be considered carefully. </p>

<p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>

<p>I would like to thank my parents for their input and keen ability to find the typographical errors that my eyes skim over - despite reading the piece a few dozen times. I would like to thank Melinda Kuwik for her support and help with titling the piece, and her willingness to read whatever I write, and encourage me to write more. The input from my revision group, Rebecca, Alex and Kate, served as a great impetus for me to improve the cohesiveness of my piece. Professor Harris, who assigned this project, was integral in guiding me through this process, offering deft minor improvements and rooting my piece in the purpose of the assignment. Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention the poetic greats who published the works that I greedily reformatted, debauched, and peeled apart to create this piece.</p>
